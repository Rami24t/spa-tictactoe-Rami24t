## Challenge:

### Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game

- To start your project clone the Tic-Tac-Toe-starter.
- You will get the board for your game and some functionality.
- You need to separate them into the corresponding components _Examples of components: Square, Board, Game._ and you will need to add extra functionality.
- You should have 2 players, **player X** starts the game and then **player O** continues.
- keep alternating the moves between the 2 players until one of the players has drawn a row of three of their symbols or until the board is full and nobody wins.
- Display the information when a player wins. The players should have the option to restart the game.

-   SASS is included in the starter package but you could use CSS instead.

-   Images for reference:
